# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Medium Digest Summarizer project and provides guidance for secure deployment and operation.

## üîí Repository Security Status

### ‚úÖ Security Cleanup Completed

This repository has undergone a comprehensive security cleanup:

- **Sensitive webhook URLs** completely removed from all files and Git history
- **Authentication cookies** completely removed from all files and Git history  
- **Git history rewritten** to purge all traces of sensitive data
- **Enhanced .gitignore** to prevent future accidental commits

### üö® Critical Security Requirements

Before deploying this application, you **MUST**:

1. **Replace placeholder values** with your actual credentials:
   - `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in CDK stack
   - `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MEDIUM_COOKIES` in deployment scripts

2. **Never commit actual credentials** to version control
3. **Use AWS Secrets Manager** for all sensitive configuration

## üîê Secrets Management

### Required Secrets

The application requires two secrets to be configured:

#### 1. Slack Webhook URL
- **Purpose**: Send formatted article summaries to Slack
- **Format**: `https://hooks.slack.com/triggers/YOUR_WORKSPACE/YOUR_TRIGGER/YOUR_TOKEN`
- **Storage**: AWS Secrets Manager (`slack-webhook-url`)

#### 2. Medium Authentication Cookies
- **Purpose**: Access Medium articles for content extraction
- **Format**: Browser cookie string (nonce, uid, sid, etc.)
- **Storage**: AWS Secrets Manager (`medium-cookies`)

### Secure Configuration Process

1. **Create Slack Webhook**:
   ```bash
   # In your Slack workspace, create a new webhook trigger
   # Copy the generated webhook URL
   ```

2. **Extract Medium Cookies**:
   ```bash
   # Login to Medium in your browser
   # Open Developer Tools > Application > Cookies
   # Copy the cookie string
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Secrets Manager**:
   ```bash
   # Use the deployment script with your actual values
   python deploy.py --profile medium-digest
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: All secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager with KMS encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use HTTPS/TLS
- **Access Control**: Lambda functions use least-privilege IAM roles

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All external communications encrypted
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for Medium API calls
- **Webhook Validation**: Slack webhook URLs validated before use

### Monitoring and Auditing

- **CloudWatch Logs**: All function executions logged (without sensitive data)
- **CloudTrail**: API access auditing enabled
- **Error Alerting**: Notifications for security-related failures

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Never Do This:

```python
# DON'T: Hardcode secrets in code
webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/triggers/T123/B456/xyz789"
cookies = "nonce=abc123; uid=def456; sid=ghi789"

# DON'T: Log sensitive data
logger.info(f"Using webhook: {webhook_url}")

# DON'T: Store secrets in environment variables in CDK
environment={
    "WEBHOOK_URL": "https://hooks.slack.com/..."
}
```

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:

```python
# DO: Use Secrets Manager
webhook_url = get_secret("slack-webhook-url")
cookies = get_secret("medium-cookies")

# DO: Log without sensitive data
logger.info("Retrieved webhook URL from Secrets Manager")

# DO: Reference secrets securely in CDK
environment={
    "SLACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET_NAME": self.slack_webhook_secret.secret_name
}
```

## üîç Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Security Review

- [ ] All placeholder values replaced with actual secrets
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Secrets Manager configured with proper values
- [ ] IAM roles follow least-privilege principle
- [ ] CloudWatch logging enabled (without sensitive data)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for external APIs

### Post-Deployment Security Verification

- [ ] Test webhook functionality with non-production data
- [ ] Verify secrets are retrieved correctly from Secrets Manager
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs for any exposed sensitive data
- [ ] Confirm rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test error handling doesn't expose secrets

### Ongoing Security Maintenance

- [ ] Regularly rotate Medium authentication cookies
- [ ] Monitor for webhook URL changes in Slack
- [ ] Review CloudWatch logs for security anomalies
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Audit IAM permissions periodically

## üö® Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke the compromised Slack webhook URL
   - Generate new Medium authentication cookies
   - Update AWS Secrets Manager with new values

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review CloudWatch logs for unauthorized access
   - Check CloudTrail for API access patterns
   - Identify the source of the compromise

3. **Recovery**:
   - Deploy updated secrets to production
   - Test functionality with new credentials
   - Monitor for any residual issues

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Do NOT** commit fixes that expose the vulnerability
3. **Do** contact the maintainers privately
4. **Do** provide detailed information about the issue
